CS109 MIS Project

To install, in directory jzheng13/hw4/, run
  make

To run the program, usage:
  On the server computer: 
    MIS_server [address] port 
      [address]: The address the server should listen on. If none specified, listens on all available.
	  port: The port the server should listen on. 

  Once the server is running, on the client computer: 
    MIS_client [-f] address port filename
      address: address of the server you wish to connect to
      port: the port of the server you wish to connect to
	  filename: name of the mis program file (must be of form “filename.mis”)
      [-f] option: since we need to send programs over the network, and output is printed to files, by default, program length and instruction execution count is limited. The -f flag removes this limit.
